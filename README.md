SavourSync:
This project allows users to select a restaurant to order from, place an order, and be matched with users from the dataset with similar taste.
They can then explore other foods tried out by their matches, providing customized and more personal recommendations.
Note that to be matched with users, you must order from the same restaurant at least twice for it to be added to your list of preferred restaurants.
